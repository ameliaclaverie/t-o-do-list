## Part II
- Start the server by right-clicking the index.html file and selecting "Start with Live Server". Once it's started, you should see it in your browser.

- You will need to use the functions listed at the top of the file to get it working. If you don't remember what they do or how to use them, read your notes at the bottom of the file and/or remember that [google.com](google.com) is your friend.

** Note: You do not need to edit the index.html to get it working **
